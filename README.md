# ODrive-Control
My Version of R2 Droid Drive-Controller

I use this Board:
[Odrive-V36](https://eu.odriverobotics.com/shop/odrive-v36)

The Basic Concept uses two mixed PWM Channels to Control the Droid. 

## The Failsafe sould be engaged in your RC Reciever!!!
## PWM ODrive can't do Failsave it self!!!

As Motor i use the phub-29a from [PeiPeiScooter](https://www.peipeiscooter.com/4-inch-double-shaft-brushless-electric-scooter-hub-motor-phub-29a.html] 
Other Motors will need a special Setup
